## Docker Project

### Installing Docker
I will be installing Docker in [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). Use this link if you are installing Docker in [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).  
If you are not in your admin account, you must add the user account to the docker-userss group.
- As an administrator, run Computer Manager. Navigate to Local Users and Group, Groups, docker-users and right click to add the user to the group. 
- Or run Docker as an administrator.
- 
Docker Compose should be installed by default on Docker Desktop.
