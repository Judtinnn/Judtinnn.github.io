## Docker Project

### Installing Docker
- I will be installing Docker in [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). Use this link if you are installing Docker in [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).  
- Check the "System requirements" and make sure you have everything, such as enabling WSL 2, enable virtualization, installing the Linux Kernel update package, and more. 
- If you are not in your admin account, you must add the user account to the docker-users group, or run Docker as an administrator.
  - As an administrator, run Computer Manager. Navigate to Local Users and Group, Groups, docker-users and right click to add the user to the group. 
- If there is any pop up message after running Docker, following the instructions given. 
- Docker Compose should be installed by default on Docker Desktop.
