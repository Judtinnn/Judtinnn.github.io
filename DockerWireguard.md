### DigitalOcean Account
The first step is to create an account in [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/4d7f4ff9cfe4) (this link will get you $200 credit for 2 months of usage). Create a new account regardless of whether you have an account or not in DigitalOcean with the link provided. You can create your account through Google, Github, or email (I chose email). After you sign up, they will ask for verfication through email. They will also ask for a payment method to verify your account. Make sure you delete your account once you are done using it to prevent unwanted payments. Click the top left logo to begin creating Ubuntu 20.04 Droplet.
